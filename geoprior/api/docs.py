class DocstringComponents:
    r"""
    A class for managing and cleaning docstring components for classes, methods,
    or functions. It provides structured access to raw docstrings by parsing 
    them from a dictionary, optionally stripping outer whitespace, and allowing
    dot access to the components.

    This class is typically used to standardize, clean, and manage the 
    docstrings for different components of a codebase (such as methods or classes),
    particularly when docstrings contain multiple components that need to be 
    extracted, cleaned, and accessed easily.

    Parameters
    ----------
    comp_dict : dict
        A dictionary where the keys are component names and the values are 
        the raw docstring contents. The dictionary may contain entries such as 
        "description", "parameters", "returns", etc.

    strip_whitespace : bool, optional, default=True
        If True, it will remove leading and trailing whitespace from each
        entry in the `comp_dict`. If False, the whitespace will be retained.

    Attributes
    ----------
    entries : dict
        A dictionary containing the cleaned or raw docstring components after 
        parsing, depending on the `strip_whitespace` flag. These components 
        are accessible via dot notation.

    Methods
    -------
    __getattr__(attr)
        Provides dot access to the components in `self.entries`. If the requested
        attribute exists in `self.entries`, it is returned. Otherwise, it attempts
        to look for the attribute normally or raise an error if not found.

    from_nested_components(cls, **kwargs)
        A class method that allows combining multiple sub-sets of docstring
        components into a single `DocstringComponents` instance.

    Examples
    --------
    # Example 1: Creating a DocstringComponents object with basic docstrings
    doc_dict = {
        "description": "This function adds two numbers.",
        "parameters": "a : int\n    First number.\nb : int\n    Second number.",
        "returns": "int\n    The sum of a and b."
    }

    doc_comp = DocstringComponents(doc_dict)
    print(doc_comp.description)
    # Output: This function adds two numbers.

    # Example 2: Using `from_nested_components` to add multiple sub-sets
    sub_dict_1 = {
        "description": "This function multiplies two numbers.",
        "parameters": "a : int\n    First number.\nb : int\n    Second number.",
        "returns": "int\n    The product of a and b."
    }
    sub_dict_2 = {
        "example": "example_func(2, 3) # Returns 6"
    }

    doc_comp = DocstringComponents.from_nested_components(sub_dict_1, sub_dict_2)

_shared_nn_params = dict(
    input_dim = r"""
input_dim: int
    The dimensionality of each input variable. This defines the number of
    features (or the length of the feature vector) for each individual input.
    For scalar features, this value is typically ``1``. However, for more
    complex data types such as embeddings, images, or time series, the input
    dimension can be greater than 1, reflecting the number of dimensions in
    the input vectors or feature matrices. This parameter is important for
    ensuring the correct shape and consistency of input data when training
    the model.

    Example:
    - For a single scalar feature per sample, ``input_dim = 1``.
    - For a word embedding with a 300-dimensional vector for each word, 
      ``input_dim = 300``.
    - For time-series data with 10 features at each time step, 
      ``input_dim = 10``.
    """, 
    
    units = r"""
units: int
    The number of units in the attention layer. This parameter defines
    the dimensionality of the output space for the attention mechanism.
    It determines the size of the internal representation for each input
    and plays a significant role in model capacity and performance.
    Larger values provide more capacity to capture complex patterns,
    but may also lead to higher computational costs. The number of units
    influences how well the model can learn complex representations from
    the input data. A larger number of units can improve performance on 
    more challenging tasks, but it can also increase memory and 
    computational requirements, so tuning this parameter is important.
    """,

    num_heads = r"""
num_heads: int
    The number of attention heads in the multi-head attention mechanism.
    Multiple attention heads allow the model to focus on different aspects
    of the input data, capturing more complex relationships within the
    data. More heads provide better representation power but increase
    computational costs. This parameter is crucial in self-attention
    mechanisms where each head can attend to different parts of the input
    data in parallel, improving the model's ability to capture diverse
    features. For example, in natural language processing, multiple heads
    allow the model to attend to different semantic aspects of the text.
    Using more heads can increase the model's capacity to learn complex
    features, but it also requires more memory and computational power.
    """,

    dropout_rate = r"""
dropout_rate: float, optional
    The dropout rate applied during training to prevent overfitting.
    Dropout is a regularization technique where a fraction of input units
    is randomly set to zero at each training step to prevent the model from
    relying too heavily on any one feature. This helps improve generalization
    and can make the model more robust. Dropout is particularly effective
    in deep learning models where overfitting is a common issue. The value
    should be between 0.0 and 1.0, where a value of ``0.0`` means no dropout
    is applied and a value of ``1.0`` means that all units are dropped. 
    A typical value for ``dropout_rate`` ranges from 0.1 to 0.5.
    """,

    activation = r"""
activation: str, optional
    The activation function to use in the Gated Recurrent Networks (GRNs).
    The activation function defines how the model's internal representations
    are transformed before being passed to the next layer. Supported values
    include:
    
    - ``'elu'``: Exponential Linear Unit (ELU), a variant of ReLU that
      improves training performance by preventing dying neurons. ELU provides
      a smooth output for negative values, which can help mitigate the issue 
      of vanishing gradients. The mathematical formulation for ELU is:
      
      .. math:: 
          f(x) = 
          \begin{cases}
          x & \text{if } x > 0 \\
          \alpha (\exp(x) - 1) & \text{if } x \leq 0
          \end{cases}
      
      where \(\alpha\) is a constant (usually 1.0).

    - ``'relu'``: Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU), a widely used activation
      function that outputs zero for negative input and the input itself for
      positive values. It is computationally efficient and reduces the risk
      of vanishing gradients. The mathematical formulation for ReLU is:
      
      .. math:: 
          f(x) = \max(0, x)
      
      where \(x\) is the input value.

    - ``'tanh'``: Hyperbolic Tangent, which squashes the outputs into a range 
      between -1 and 1. It is useful when preserving the sign of the input
      is important, but can suffer from vanishing gradients for large inputs.
      The mathematical formulation for tanh is:
      
      .. math::
          f(x) = \frac{2}{1 + \exp(-2x)} - 1

    - ``'sigmoid'``: Sigmoid function, commonly used for binary classification
      tasks, maps outputs between 0 and 1, making it suitable for probabilistic
      outputs. The mathematical formulation for sigmoid is:
      
      .. math:: 
          f(x) = \frac{1}{1 + \exp(-x)}

    - ``'linear'``: No activation (identity function), often used in regression
      tasks where no non-linearity is needed. The output is simply the input value:
      
      .. math:: 
          f(x) = x

    The default activation function is ``'elu'``.
    """,

    use_batch_norm = r"""
use_batch_norm: bool, optional
    Whether to use batch normalization in the Gated Recurrent Networks (GRNs).
    Batch normalization normalizes the input to each layer, stabilizing and
    accelerating the training process. When set to ``True``, it normalizes the
    activations by scaling and shifting them to maintain a stable distribution
    during training. This technique can help mitigate issues like vanishing and
    exploding gradients, making it easier to train deep networks. Batch normalization
    also acts as a form of regularization, reducing the need for other techniques
    like dropout. By default, batch normalization is turned off (``False``).
    
    """, 
    
    hidden_units = """
hidden_units: int
    The number of hidden units in the model's layers. This parameter 
    defines the size of the hidden layers throughout the model, including 
    Gated Recurrent Networks (GRNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers, 
    and fully connected layers. Increasing the value of ``hidden_units`` 
    enhances the model's capacity to capture more complex relationships and 
    patterns from the data. However, it also increases computational costs 
    due to a higher number of parameters. The choice of hidden units should 
    balance model capacity and computational feasibility, depending on the 
    complexity of the problem and available resources.
    """,

quantiles = """
quantiles: list of float or None, optional
    A list of quantiles to predict for each time step. For example, 
    specifying ``[0.1, 0.5, 0.9]`` would result in the model predicting 
    the 10th, 50th, and 90th percentiles of the target variable at each 
    time step. This is useful for estimating prediction intervals and 
    capturing uncertainty in forecasting tasks. If set to ``None``, the model 
    performs point forecasting and predicts a single value (e.g., the mean 
    or most likely value) for each time step. Quantile forecasting is commonly 
    used for applications where it is important to predict not just the 
    most likely outcome, but also the range of possible outcomes.

_shared_docs: dict[str, str] = {}

_shared_docs[
    "data"
] = """data : array-like, pandas.DataFrame, str, dict, or Path-like
    The input `data`, which can be either an array-like object (e.g., 
    list, tuple, or numpy array), a pandas DataFrame, a file path 
    (string or Path-like), or a dictionary. The function will 
    automatically convert it into a pandas DataFrame for further 
    processing based on its type. Here's how each type is handled:

    1. **Array-like (list, tuple, numpy array)**:
       If `data` is array-like (e.g., a list, tuple, or numpy array), 
       it will be converted to a pandas DataFrame. Each element in 
       the array will correspond to a row in the resulting DataFrame. 
       The columns can be specified manually if desired, or pandas 
       will auto-generate column names.

       Example:
       >>> data = [ [1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9] ]
       >>> df = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=['A', 'B', 'C'])
       >>> print(df)
          A  B  C
       0  1  2  3
       1  4  5  6
       2  7  8  9

    2. **pandas.DataFrame**:
       If `data` is already a pandas DataFrame, it will be returned as 
       is without any modification. This allows flexibility for cases 
       where the input data is already in DataFrame format.

       Example:
       >>> data = pd.DataFrame({'A': [1, 2], 'B': [3, 4]})
       >>> print(data)
          A  B
       0  1  3
       1  2  4

    3. **File path object (str or Path-like)**:
       If `data` is a file path (either a string or Path-like object), 
       it will be read and converted into a pandas DataFrame. Supported 
       file formats include CSV, Excel, and other file formats that can 
       be read by pandas' `read_*` methods. This enables seamless 
       reading of data directly from files.

       Example:
       >>> data = "data.csv"
       >>> df = pd.read_csv(data)
       >>> print(df)
          A  B  C
       0  1  2  3
       1  4  5  6

    4. **Dictionary**:
       If `data` is a dictionary, it will be converted into a pandas 
       DataFrame. The dictionary's keys become the column names, and 
       the values become the corresponding rows. This is useful when 
       the data is already structured as key-value pairs.

       Example:
       >>> data = {'A': [1, 2, 3], 'B': [4, 5, 6]}
       >>> df = pd.DataFrame(data)
       >>> print(df)
          A  B
       0  1  4
       1  2  5
       2  3  6

    The `data` parameter can accept a variety of input types and will 
    be converted into a pandas DataFrame accordingly. In case of invalid 
    types or unsupported formats, a `ValueError` will be raised to notify 
    the user of the issue.

    Notes
    ------
    If `data` is an unsupported type or cannot be converted into a 
    pandas DataFrame, a `ValueError` will be raised with a clear 
    error message describing the issue.

    The `data` parameter will be returned as a pandas DataFrame, 
    regardless of its initial format.

    Threshold value for converting probabilities to binary labels

    In binary classification or multilabel classification, classifiers 
    often output a probability score for each class. The `threshold` 
    parameter determines the cutoff point for converting these probabilities 
    into binary labels (0 or 1). If the predicted probability for a class 
    exceeds the given `threshold`, the label is assigned to that class (i.e., 
    it is classified as 1). Otherwise, the label is assigned to the alternative 
    class (i.e., 0).

    For example, in a binary classification task where the model outputs 
    probabilities, if the `threshold` is set to `{value}`, any prediction with 
    a probability greater than or equal to `0.5` is classified as class 1, 
    while predictions below `{value}` are classified as class 0.

    Defines how to handle NaN (Not a Number) values in the input arrays
    (`y_true` or `y_pred`):
    
    - ``'omit'``: Ignores any NaN values in the input arrays (`y_true` or
      `y_pred`). This option is useful when you want to exclude samples 
      with missing or invalid data from the metric calculation, effectively 
      removing them from the analysis. If this option is chosen, NaN values 
      are treated as non-existent, and the metric is computed using only the 
      valid samples. It is a common choice in cases where the data set has 
      sparse missing values and you do not want these missing values to affect 
      the result.
      
    - ``'propagate'``: Leaves NaN values in the input data unchanged. This 
      option allows NaNs to propagate through the metric calculation. When 
      this option is selected, any NaN values encountered during the computation 
      process will result in the entire metric (or output) being set to NaN. 
      This is useful when you want to track the occurrence of NaNs or understand 
      how their presence affects the metric. It can be helpful when debugging 
      models or when NaN values themselves are of interest in the analysis.
      
    - ``'raise'``: Raises an error if any NaN values are found in the input 
      arrays. This option is ideal for scenarios where you want to ensure that 
      NaN values do not go unnoticed and potentially disrupt the calculation. 
      Selecting this option enforces data integrity, ensuring that the analysis 
      will only proceed if all input values are valid and non-missing. If a NaN 
      value is encountered, it raises an exception (typically a `ValueError`), 
      allowing you to catch and handle such cases immediately.

    This parameter is especially useful in situations where missing or 
    invalid data is a concern. Depending on how you want to handle incomplete 
    data, you can choose one of the options that best suits your needs.

    Example:
    >>> nan_policy = 'omit'  # Ignore NaNs in `y_true` or `y_pred` and 
    >>> nan_policy = 'propagate'  # Let NaNs propagate; if any NaN is 
    >>> nan_policy = 'raise'  # Raise an error if NaNs are found in the
